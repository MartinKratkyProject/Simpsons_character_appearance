# Simpsons_character_appearance
Shows an appearance of characters in each episode based on association rules.

This project is in an ongoing stage. 
Currently, I am working on a binary association matrix. 

So far, this project contains: 
    1. Jupyter notebook file for episode name scraping and preproccesing,
    2. Excel file dataset with episode name,
    3. Jupyter notebook file for character name scraping and preproccesing. (Ongoing)
